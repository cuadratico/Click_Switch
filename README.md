Click Switch is an app developed by an independent person. Because I need 20 testers to be able to publish it in the Google Play Store, I leave it for free here, if you have any problem with the app or want to update it, you can tell me everything.
You can also make Commits that I will try to push every day, thank you for your collaboration.

To download the .apk file go to app/release/app-release.apk
