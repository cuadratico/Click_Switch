# Click_Switch

- Click_Switch is a game where you have to click the color button that appears and not the textColor button.

- Click_Switch does not collect user information and it is advisable to use it without internet access since it does not require it.

- Click_Switch, like the rest of my apps, is in the process of being uploaded to https://f-droid.org/es/ for easy access.
